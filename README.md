# Waste recycling

## Story
Imagine a future where waste management is as simple as sorting your trash into the right bin. The project, *Waste Recycling*, brings that future one step closer by introducing a smart waste sorting system. Using advanced technology, our bins can automatically identify different types of waste and guide users on proper disposal.
